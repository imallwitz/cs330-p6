    <p class="text">Here's some more information on one of my recent art projects.</p>
    <p class="text">Last fall I played in a Monster of the Week campaign. It was a ton of fun, and I really loved the character that I played. I had fun designing them, and their adventures really inspired my art. I drew them a lot, and this is just one of the pieces that I created based on them.</p>
    <p class="text">Their name is Riley, and they're a college student/barista/hardware supply store worker/monster hunter. They have a variety of hats, and part of their story was learning how to balance their mortal life with their supernatural experiences. The playbook for Riley was The Mundane, which is a playbook all about the "normal" person in a monster hunting gang, the person who has no special powers or connections to the unknown, who stumbled into this unnatural world and decided to stick around to help out.</p>
    <p class="text"> Here you see my finalized piece, as well as a progress video for the creation of the piece. The art program I use, Procreate, allows you to export the progress videos of all of your works, which is super helpful, and the videos are always fun to watch.</p>
