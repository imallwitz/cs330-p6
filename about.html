    <h1 class="header">About Me</h1>
    <p class="text">I'm a second-year undergraduate student at Northwestern University studying Human-Computer Interaction through the McCormick Integrated Engineering Studies (MIES) program. I wasn't satisfied with any of the majors offered, so I made my own, focusing on the intersections of computer science, design, and education. I am also pursuing a minor in Art Theory and Practice.</p>
    <p class="text">On campus, I'm involved in the tiilt lab, ResilientNU, Develop + Innovate for Social Change (DISC), and Society of Women Engineers (SWE). I am the Recruitment Lead for ResilientNU, and the Co-President of SWE.</p>
    <p class="text">On the personal side, I come from a Midwestern family, but I grew up in a suburb of LA. I love spending time with my friends outside, as well as listening to music, drawing, and talking about podcasts. I have a huge collection of graphic novels, and a great passion for baking the best cookies possible.</p>
